The concept of [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) is super intriguing to me.

It appeals to my educator's side, and I've personally benefitted a lot from
others who've embraced this approach. One of my favorite sites, [Tania
Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/), follows this approach.

It also intimidates me, which is why I think I should try it.

## Ideas for how to do this

Part of what holds me back from "learning in public" is that I don't like
showing my unstructured/unpolished thoughts. This is likely rooted in my fear of
coming off as stupid or ignorant.

To kick that fear, I might have to just be more comfortable with unstructured
thoughts being out in the open. Otherwise, if I keep waiting for thoughts to
become structured, then I'll likely end up not writing/publishing anything.

To start, I'll have an unstructured series of `Today I Learned (TIL)` notes,
where I jot down things that I'm learning each day. Then, each week, I'll try to
sum up those unstructured thoughts into a more thought-out post.
