The concept of [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) is super intriguing to me.

It appeals to my educator's side, and I've personally benefitted a lot from
others who've embraced this approach. One of my favorite sites, [Tania
Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/), follows this approach.

It also intimidates me, which is why I think I should try it.

## Ideas for how to do this

Part of what holds me back from "learning in public" is that it takes me too
long to polish my thoughts to a state where I'm comfortable sharing them. As a
result, there's often too much inertia when it comes to sharing any writing.

As a catalyst, I might have to just be more comfortable with publishing
unstructured thoughts.

To start, I'll have a series of unstructured [[today-i-learned]] notes (inspired
by [https://github.com/jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)),
where I quickly jot down things that I'm learning each day. Then, each week,
I'll try to sum up those unstructured thoughts into a more thought-out post.
