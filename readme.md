# Learn in public 

The concept of [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) is super intriguing to me.

It appeals to my educator's side, and I've personally benefitted a lot from others
who've embraced this approach. One of my favorite personal sites, [Tania
Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/) follows this approach.

It also intimidates me, which is why I think I should try it.
