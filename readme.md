The concept of [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) is super intriguing to me.

It appeals to my educator's side, and I've personally benefitted a lot from
others who've embraced this approach. One of my favorite sites, [Tania
Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/), follows this approach.

It also intimidates me, which is why I think I should try it.

## Ideas for how to do this

Part of what holds me back from "learning in public" is that it takes me too
long to structure and polish my thoughts to a state where I'm comfortable
sharing them. As a result, there's often too much inertia when it comes to
sharing any sort of writing.

I might have to just be more comfortable with sharing unstructured
thoughts as a catalyst.

To start, I'll have an series of unstructured [[today-i-learned]] notes,
where I quickly jot down things that I'm learning each day. Then, each week,
I'll try to sum up those unstructured thoughts into a more thought-out post.
