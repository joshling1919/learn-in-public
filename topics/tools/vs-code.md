  ## Text Auto-wrap [[2020-07-20]]

  I've been trying to turn on auto text wrap while I'm editing markdown in VS
  Code.

  Previously, I had used the [`Rewrap`
  extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap) to
  manually rewrap paragraphs, but had no idea that it also had the ability to
  [auto-wrap](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/wiki/Auto-wrap).
