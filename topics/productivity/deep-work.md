  ## 25 minutes [[2020-07-20]]

  According to [this blog
  post](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/),
  it takes approximately 25 minutes of focus without distraction to reach a state
  of flow.

  For a while, I've rationalized that as long as I'm [not having a "zero
  day"](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948),
  then that's good enough.

  While a little progress is better than no progress, it's foolish to become
  satisfied with a state of consistent little progress.

  For example, I used to think that 10 minutes of practicing Rust each day is good
  enough, as long as I do it for a sustained period of time. If I end up doing 10
  minutes per day for six months, that adds up to ~30 hours. That time would
  be infinitely more productive if I instead broke it up into six blocks of
  uninterrupted, 4-hour, deep dives into Rust like the author of that blog
  suggested.
