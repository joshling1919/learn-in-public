## [[deep-work]]

According to [this blog
post](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/),
it takes approzimately 25 minutes of focus without distraction to reach a state
of flow.

This is interesting because I think I had settled too much for the concept of
[not having "zero
days"](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948).

While a little progress is better than no progress, it's foolish to become
satisfied with a state of consistent little progress.

## [[vs-code]]

One thing that I've been trying to do for a while is turn on auto text wrap
while I'm editing markdown.

I had the [`Rewrap`
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap) for
a while, but had no idea that it also had the ability to auto-wrap:
