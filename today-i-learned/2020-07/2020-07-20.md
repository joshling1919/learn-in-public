## [[deep-work]]

According to [this blog
post](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/),
it takes approximately 25 minutes of focus without distraction to reach a state
of flow.

For a while, I've rationalized that as long as I'm [not having a "zero
day"](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948),
then that's good enough.

While a little progress is better than no progress, it's foolish to become
satisfied with a state of consistent little progress.

For example, I used to think that 10 minutes of practicing Rust each day is good
enough, as long as I do it for a sustained period of time. If I end up doing 10
minutes per day for six months, that adds up to ~30 hours. That time would
be infinitely more productive if I instead broke it up into six blocks of
uninterrupted, 4-hour, deep dives into Rust like the author of that blog
suggested.

## [[vs-code]]

I've been trying to turn on auto text wrap while I'm editing markdown in VS
Code.

Previously, I had used the [`Rewrap`
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap) to
manually rewrap paragraphs, but had no idea that it also had the ability to
[auto-wrap](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/wiki/Auto-wrap).
